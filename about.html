<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>My name is Frank Ji, and I live in the heart of the city of Toronto.
I am a software developer currently working at IBM Canada. My team builds one of
the key infrastructures used by pretty much all of the major banks and financial
institutions in North America. In that sense, I feel good about the fact that my
work impacted millions of users. In my leisure time, I am pursuing a long list
of interests to keep myself entertained. And I will be sharing some of the most
exciting things I learned or encountered in my blog.</p>
