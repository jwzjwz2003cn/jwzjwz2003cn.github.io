        <p class="image-caption">Hangzhou(on the left) and Kyoto(on the right) share some striking resemblances in city landscapes</p>
    
</div>

<p>When I was traveling to Japan and China a fews ago, I was amazed by the similarities shared by two of the cities which I visited: Hangzhou of China and Kyoto of Japan. I kept reminded myself to write something to compare the duo after the trip. And luckily for me, I finally find some today to do it.</p>

<h3>Location and Transportation</h3>
<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    
        <img src="/images/pic_kyoto_HZ_2.jpg" alt="Kyoto vs Hangzhou 2" />
    
    
        <p class="image-caption">China High Speed Rail first class cabin seat(on the left) and Japan Rail Shinkansen economic cabin seat(on the right) </p>
    
</div>

<p>Since they shared so many things in common, it’s hard to find a specific one to start with. I guess I’ll start with the location then. Yes, they locate thousands miles apart and are in two different countries. That being said, both of the cities are very close to the countries’ economic hub. Hangzhou is fairly close to Shanghai whereas Kyoto is literally right next to Osaka and still not being too far from Kyoto. More over, both of cities are located on top of a high speed rail way line (or Shinkansen in Japanese). So getting in and out of both cities is extremely convenient. I’ll probably write another article to compare the two countries rail way system in another time. But my overall experience was pleasant for both CRH and JR as they were punctual and blazingly fast. And I could only wish if we have something like that in North America.</p>

<h3>Cityscape</h3>

        <p class="image-caption">Lei Feng Pagoda of Hanzhou(on the top) and Kinkaku-ji of Kyoto(on the bottom) </p>
    
</div>

<p>The two cities share some striking resemblances in cityscapes too, despite the fact that Hangzhou is built surrounding a lake while Kyoto does not feature a lake. For example Both cities have mountains and hills surrounded with rivers flowing through. Also, both cities are filled with historical sites that are on the UNESCO World Heritage list. In Kyoto, I could get off at every bus stop and find a temple or a shrine that’s hundreds of years old. Same is true for Hangzhou, every gardens, pagodas and bridges I encountered in the West Lake and surrounding area can be traced back to centuries ago. Oh, did I even mention the history of two cities? It turns out that they were both once served as the capital city of the country. Kyoto today still preserves the imperial Palace of the Japan emperor. Unfortunately for Hangzhou, the old imperial palace of Song Dynasty was long destroyed in war.</p>

</div>

<p>Away from the serene and peaceful historical part of the city, they both have another more modernized and vibrant city center that appeals to the younger generation. Coincidentally and ironically, both of the two ancient cities strive at the forefront of technology. Kyoto houses the headquarter of Nintendo, the maker of SuperMario. Hangzhou is the home of the Alibaba, the largest e-commerce company of the world.</p>

<h3>Food and Drink</h3>

        <p class="image-caption">Some interesting deserts I had from restaurants in Hangzhou</p>
    
</div>

<p>The food of both cities are elegant but comes in small quantity. If I take away the differences between of Chinese food and Japanese food, I do find the food between the two cities are similar in principle. For instance, both places prefer to use local grown only crops as the food ingredients. A lot of the time, I can’t even tell what exactly am I eating other than admitting that they are extremely tasty. Another common thing the two cities share between the food are their imagination in making deserts. I have been fortunate to experience some of the most creative desserts in both places, and they are are truly a pleasant to enjoy.

</div>

<p>Both of the cities are famous for their teas too. Hangzhou’s dragon well tea and Kyoto’s Uji tea are both some the finest teas the world produces.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>
<p>Of all the places I’ve been to, I’ve yet to seen another duo that resembles each other as Hangzhou and Kyoto. And it’s definitely worth the effort to visit both places just to experience the history and the people that made the two cities. They both represent the pinnacle of Chinese and Japanese culture. I am looking forward to visit both places again in the future.</p>
