When I was traveling to Japan and China a fews ago, I was amazed by the similarities shared by two of the cities which I visited: Hangzhou of China and Kyoto of Japan. I kept reminded myself to write something to compare the duo after the trip. And luckily for me, I finally find some time today to do it.

<h3>Location and Transportation</h3>

Since they share so many things in common, it's hard to find a specific topic to start with. I guess I'll start with the location then. Yes, they locate thousands of miles apart from each other and are in two different countries. That being said, both of the cities are very close to the countries' economic hubs. Hangzhou is fairly close to Shanghai and Jiangsu whereas Kyoto is literally right next to Osaka and still not being too far away from Tokyo. More over, both of cities are located on top of a high speed rail way line (or Shinkansen in Japanese). So getting in and out of both cities is extremely convenient. I'll probably write another article to compare the two countries railway system in some other time. But my overall experience was pleasant for both CRH and JR as they were punctual and blazingly fast. And I could only wish if we have something like that in North America.

<h3>Cityscape</h3>

The two cities share some striking resemblances in cityscapes too, despite the fact that Hangzhou is built surrounding a lake while Kyoto does not have such feature. For example, Both cities have mountains and hills surrounded with rivers flowing through. Also, both cities are filled with historical sites, many of which are even on the UNESCO World Heritage list. In Kyoto, I could get off at every bus stop and find a temple or a shrine that's over hundreds of years old. Same can be said  for Hangzhou too. Every garden, pagoda and bridge I encountered in the West Lake and the surrounding areas can be traced back to centuries ago. Oh, did I even mention the history of two cities? It turns out that they were both once served as the capital city of the country. Kyoto today still preserves the imperial Palace of the Japan emperor. Unfortunately for Hangzhou, the old imperial palace of Song Dynasty has long been destroyed in war.

Away from the serene and peaceful historical part of the city, they both feature a modernized and vibrant city center that appeals to the younger generation. Coincidentally and ironically, both of the two the ancient cities strive at the forefront of technology. Kyoto houses the headquarter of Nintendo, the maker of SuperMario. Hangzhou is the home of the Alibaba, the largest e-commerce company of the world.

<h3>Food and Drink</h3>

The food of both cities are very elegant but comes in small quantity. If I just take away the differences between of Chinese food and Japanese food, I do find the two cities share some similar principles when it comes to cooking. For one, both places prefer to use some rare local grown only vegetables as the food ingredients. A lot of the time, I can't even tell what exactly am I eating since I don't recognize any ingredient from the dishes . Another common thing the two cities share between the food are their imagination in making desserts. I have been fortunate to experience some of the most creative desserts in both places, and they are truly a treat to your sweet sensory nerves.

Both of the cities are famous for their teas too. Both Hangzhou's dragon well tea and Kyoto's Uji tea are some the finest and most expensive teas the world produces.

<h3>Verdict</h3>
Of all the places I've been to, I've yet to seen another duo that resembles each other as Hangzhou and Kyoto. And it's definitely worth the effort to visit both places just to experience the history and the people that made the two cities. They definitely represent the finest of Chinese and Japanese culture. I am looking forward to visit both places again in the future.
